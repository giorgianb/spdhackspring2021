# About ΣΦΔ Hack Spring 2021
**ΣΦΔ Hack Spring 2021** is ΣΦΔ's first annual machine learning hackathon. ΣΦΔ Hack Spring 2021 aims to introduce Stony Brook students to the rich and challenging field of machine learning, and develop the skills necessary to build sophisticated machine learning models on their own. 

# Hackathon Structure
## Task
The focus of this year's ΣΦΔ Hack Spring 2021 is natural language processing (NLP). Participants will be tasked with building a model which can correctly determine the author of a comment or post from r/SBU. The authors are anonymized and are represented using a numeric ID. Participants are encouraged to explore simple logistic models, RNNs, transformers, attention-based mechanisms, and other unique architectures in order to attack this problem.

## Provided Materials
ΣΦΔ Hack Spring 2021 participants will be given several materials to help them in impleneting their model.
* Training data from Kaggle: Participants will be able to download a CSV file from Kaggle that contain the text of a comment/post, along with the numeric ID of the author of the comment/post.
* Dataset Generation Script: While preprocessing is an important part of machine learning, we want participants to focus on experimenting with their architecture. We will provide Python scripts to generate datasets for PyTorch and Tensorflow from the CSV file. This script does some preprocessing (tokenization, vector embeddings) and participants are welcome to modify this pipeline to their needs.
* ZOOM Meeting: Participants will have access to a ZOOM meeting, in which they can ask questions and request help. Participants are encouraged to remain on the ZOOM meeting for the entirety of the call.
* Test data from Kaggle: Participants will be able to download a CSV file from Kaggle that contains a list of comments/posts to predict the author for. They will then need to upload their predictions to Kaggle. They will be able to see their results at the end of the competition. Participants are welcome, and even encouraged, to make multiple submissions and to try multiple models. We hope to encourage participants to experiment between submitting many different, loosely-tuned models, or fewer, finely-tuned models.
## Prizes
The first place winner will win a $50 Amazon Gift Card. The top-three participants will get a chance to explain how their model works to the judges and the rest of the participants. 

The winner will be determined by the model that most accurately predicts the authors of the comments/post on the test data. In case of ties, the model that was submitted first will win.

# About ΣΦΔ
ΣΦΔ is the **only** professional *and* social fraternity on campus. We are an engineering fraternity, and we are tend to recruit students who are both successful academically, and have an active social life. The connections and social bonds that you form in this fraternity will take you much further than the purely professional acquaintance-type connections you develop in a purely professional organization. Our alumni have landed jobs at companies such as Google, Intel, and Goldman Sachs, and we host frequent events with our alumni. ΣΦΔ also organizes many professional and social events, and as a brother, you have the opportunity to develop and demonstrate your leadership and organizational skills by creating these events. Most importantly, ΣΦΔ offers a small, tight-knit community that fills in important gaps left by the large, faceless community of Stony Brook University. Please contact Shafin or Felo if you are interested in rushing. Contact information listed on their flier below.
